			<!-- Brief Bio -->
			<h2 id="brief-bio">Brief Bio</h2>
			<p>I am a senior student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology at <a
					href="https://www.nefu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Northeast Forestry University</a>. I
				served as a research assistant in the humanoid robot laboratory, and studied and worked under the
				guidance
				of Professor Chen Yu for two and a half years. At the same time, I served as a research assistant in the
				"Heterogeneous Network" (uncertain name) laboratory, and worked under the guidance of Professor Wang
				Mingyang for one and a half years.
				I have participated in many practical projects and research during my four years of study and work. My
				main
				research interests include machine learning, data mining, big data analysis, and robot motion control. I
				led
				my team to win more than ten national awards in multiple robot competitions in 2021 and 2022. At the
				same
				time, I also focus on software development and have rich experience in front-end and back-end
				development. I
				have won the Best Web Award twice in international competitions. And I am familiar with the Hadoop
				ecosystem
				and have rich experience in deploying, optimizing, operating and maintaining Hadoop clusters, data
				processing, and machine learning.

				<li class="listhead"><strong>Face Recognition Situation Awareness System Based on Edge
						Computing and Deep Learning:</strong></li>
				<div class="time">Nov. 2014 – Present</div>
				<ul>
					<li>Developed a situational awareness system based on edge computing and deep learning algorithms
						that could display real-time information such as device information, time, location on face
						recognition network attacks. A facial liveness detection algorithm based on GhostNet and feature
						fusion. Divide the feature extraction process of the GhostNet model into three different stages;
						Then, output the feature map information for each stage separately; Finally, feature maps with
						different Semantic information are sent to the feature fusion module for adaptive weighted
						fusion to obtain more discriminative feature maps.
					</li>
					<li>The front-end uses Bootstrap's responsive design and layout, allowing the project to adapt to
						different screen sizes and device types. In terms of data interaction, the project uses the
						Flask framework on the backend and Ajax on the front-end. It requests a Json file from the
						backend through HTTP using the GET method and presents the data on the page. The core function
						of this project is visual data analysis, so a JavaScript based visual Echarts library is used to
						create various charts on the page to help users better understand the data.
					</li>
					<li>This project is a system that includes front-end web pages, connections between front-end and
						back-end, and data processing (such as time, IP, device mapping). It provides rich data
						visualization and interaction functions to facilitate users to better understand and use data.
					</li>
					<li>Completed the prototype design, website scaffolding, responsive layout implementation and
						website deployment.

				<!-- Experience2 -->
				<li class="listhead"><strong>Data Analysis System based on Hadoop:</strong></li>
				<div class="time">Nov. 2014 – Present</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Using the requests library to write a crawler, a total of 39458 SCI articles were collected
						with a total of 434038 parameters. A machine learning algorithm model was established to
						classify XXX,
						and keyword and link relationship analysis was performed on the SCI articles. Building a machine
						learning algorithm model to classify SCI articles after Implementing the keyword and link
						relationship
						analysis between articles.
					</li>
					<li>
						Applied Combiner and Partitioner for performance optimization to solve the problem of algorithm
						failure
						caused by the limited single machine memory and computing resources when training data is large.
					</li>
					<li>
						Establishing a fully distributed HDFS-HA high-availability cluster to realize automatic
						failover of
						NM
						and RM, and realize HDFS load balancing when processing large-scale data in MapReduce.
					</li>
					<li>
						Expect to use XGBoost and LightGBM in the Hadoop and parallelize them through MapReduce.

				<div class="time">Nov. 2014 – Present</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Expect to develop a new Multi-modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG) model that exploits information
						propagation
						in multimodal knowledge graphs to obtain better entity embeddings and improve the quality of
						recommendation system
					</li>
					<li>
						Will verify the rationality and effectiveness of model with extensive experiments on two
						large-scale
						real data sets from different domains
					</li>
					<li>
						Propose to apply Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)-based Recommendation Algorithms to Leverage
						Multimodal Knowledge Graphs for Entity Embedding and Recommendation.
